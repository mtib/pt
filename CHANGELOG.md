- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Network timeouts, retry logic, and graceful degradation
- **Improved Speech Synthesis**: Better pronunciation handling and error recovery
- **XP Calculation**: More sophisticated scoring based on response time
- **Practice Algorithm**: Improved spaced repetition with configurable parameters

### üîÑ Changed

#### Code Organization
- **Monolithic Component Split**: Main page component broken into focused, reusable components

## Development Notes

### Upgrade Path from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

1. **Data Migration**: Local storage data is automatically migrated to new format
2. **API Compatibility**: API endpoints remain backward compatible
3. **Environment Variables**: Update `.env` file according to new `.env.example`
4. **Docker**: Update Docker commands according to new Dockerfile

### Breaking Changes

- **Component API**: Internal component APIs have changed but user-facing functionality remains the same
- **File Structure**: Code organization has changed but build output is compatible
- **TypeScript**: Stricter typing may require updates if extending the codebase

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v1.0.0:

1. Pull the latest code
2. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
3. Update your `.env` file using `.env.example` as reference
4. Clear browser cache to ensure fresh assets load
5. Test authentication with your existing auth key

For developers:

1. Review new file structure in `src/` directory
