## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager
- OpenAI API key (for explanation features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd pt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   PRESHARED_KEY=your_secure_preshared_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

The application uses SQLite for vocabulary management. To populate the database:

1. **Set the import authentication key**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env.local file
   # Note: PRESHARED_KEY is used for both app auth and import operations
   PRESHARED_KEY=your_secure_import_key_here
   ```

2. **Run the migration script**
   ```bash
   # Dry run to see what will be imported
   node scripts/migrate-vocabulary.js --dry-run
   
   # Import vocabulary data (server must be running)
   node scripts/migrate-vocabulary.js
   
   # Or overwrite existing data
   node scripts/migrate-vocabulary.js --overwrite
   ```

   **Note**: The Next.js development server must be running (`npm run dev`) before running the migration script.

3. **Verify the import**
   
   Check the database statistics at: [http://localhost:3000/api/vocabulary/stats](http://localhost:3000/api/vocabulary/stats)

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Authentication Setup

To use the AI explanation features:

1. Set your `PRESHARED_KEY` in the environment variables
2. Access the app with the authentication key in the URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/#auth_YOUR_PRESHARED_KEY
   ```
3. The key will be automatically saved and the URL cleaned up

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system (no Radix/Shadcn)
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom state management
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-5-nano with structured output
- **Data Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + TypeScript for type safety
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for comprehensive unit testing

### Key Design Patterns

#### ü™ù Custom Hooks
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from UI components
- **Reusability**: Common patterns are abstracted into reusable hooks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing

#### üéØ Component Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Composition**: Complex UI is built from simple, composable components
- **Props Interface**: Consistent prop interfaces with TypeScript validation

### UI Components
- **Custom + Tailwind**: All UI elements are built with Tailwind and small custom components under `src/components/ui`.
- **No Radix/Shadcn**: Radix UI and shadcn/ui have been removed to reduce bundle size and complexity.
- **Examples**:
  - `Button`, `Card`, `Input` are minimal Tailwind components.
  - Notifications use `sonner` via a lightweight wrapper.

### Dependency Cleanup
- Removed: `@shadcn/ui`, `@radix-ui/*`, `class-variance-authority`, `cmdk`, and unused icon packs.
- Replaced Radix Select with a native `<select>` styled with Tailwind in `src/app/add/page.tsx`.

#### üì¶ State Management
- **Local Storage Integration**: Automatic persistence with error handling
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with background persistence
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of storage and parsing errors

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Basic Controls
- **Type to Answer**: Simply start typing in the active input field
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `N` - Next word
  - `S` - Show answer
  - `Space` - Speak current word
  - `E` - Explain word (requires authentication)

### Learning Flow
1. **Start Learning**: A Portuguese word is shown, you translate to English (or vice versa)
2. **Input Answer**: Type your translation in the active input field
3. **Instant Feedback**: Correct answers are highlighted immediately
4. **XP Rewards**: Faster responses earn more XP (1-10 points)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Incorrect answers add words to your practice list
6. **Explanations**: Click "Explain" for detailed AI-powered analysis

### Practice System
- Words you struggle with are automatically added to a practice list
- Practice words have a higher chance of appearing in future sessions
- After 3 correct answers, words are removed from the practice list
- The practice probability increases as your practice list grows

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required: OpenAI API key for explanations
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Required: Authentication key for API access
PRESHARED_KEY=your-secure-random-key

# Optional: Override Next.js configuration
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Customization Options

#### Learning Parameters
Modify constants in `src/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
export const CONFIG = {
  MIN_XP: 1,                    // Minimum XP per correct answer
  MAX_XP: 10,                   // Maximum XP per correct answer
  FAST_RESPONSE_TIME: 2000,     // Fast response threshold (ms)
  SLOW_RESPONSE_TIME: 30000,    // Slow response threshold (ms)
  CORRECT_DELAY: 500,           // Delay after correct answer (ms)
  REVEAL_DELAY: 2000,           // Delay after showing answer (ms)
  MAX_CORRECT_COUNT: 3,         // Attempts needed to master a word
  // ... more configuration options
} as const;
```

#### UI Theming
The application uses a custom Tailwind configuration with a dark theme. Modify `src/app/globals.css` to customize colors and styling.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker Deployment

The application includes server-side caching for both vocabulary data (30 days) and AI explanations (90 days). For production deployments, you should mount the cache directory as a volume to persist cache across container restarts.

#### Basic Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t pt-learn .

# Run the container with cache volume mounting
docker run -d \
  --name pt-learn \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  pt-learn
```

#### Docker Compose Deployment
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  pt-learn:
    image: ghcr.io/mtib/pt:latest
    # Or build from source:
    # build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - PRESHARED_KEY=${PRESHARED_KEY}
    volumes:
      - ./cache:/app/cache
      - ./logs:/app/logs  # Optional: for application logs
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Using GitHub Container Registry
```bash
# Run with persistent cache
docker run -d \
  --name pt-learn \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key \
  -e PRESHARED_KEY=your-auth-key \
  -v /host/path/to/cache:/app/cache \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/mtib/pt:latest
```

#### Cache Directory Structure
When properly mounted, your cache directory will contain:
```
cache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vocabulary.json          # Cached vocabulary data (30-day TTL)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ explanations/           # AI explanation cache (90-day TTL)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [hash1].json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [hash2].json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### Production Considerations
- **Cache Persistence**: Always mount `/app/cache` as a volume in production
- **Cache Size**: The explanation cache can grow over time. Monitor disk usage
- **Backup**: Consider backing up the cache directory for faster cold starts
- **Permissions**: Ensure the cache directory is writable by the container user

### Vercel Deployment
The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy with zero configuration

## üß™ Development
